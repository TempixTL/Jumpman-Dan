# Jumpman-Dan
A 2D Action Platformer for iOS created as my final project for my Mobile Applications class.

This project, along with a few others, was chosen by my teacher to be presented to a small panel of game and app developers in the area in May of 2017. Two notable developers represented Bottle Rocket Studios. I was ranked #2 of all the presentations, and was the highest ranking individual team.
